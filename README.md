# Firewall-User-Interface
This user interface is implemented to communicate with the firewall system coded with C++ via queues to examine the loosely coupled system. The user can use the website to add, delete,  browse and update users and rules, where the firewall system will retrieve the added rules and perform its functionality based on them.
